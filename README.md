# Causal Inference

---
Causal Inference is a great interest of mine. Coming from an Econometrics background, all I ever wanted to eliminate was that error term. Be it with instrumental variables, different research design, difference in difference, prepost analysis, and regression discontinuity, it's safe to say my goal was the same. But now, I am thankful for various ML models on the market that would allow me to do much more. 

Here, I will list my projects related to causal inference.
